                        Currently I am employed at Molecular Templates in Austin, Texas. At Molecular Templates, I am a lead formulation development and mass spectrometry scientist on the anlaytical team. I lead formulation development projects where I where
                        I design and execute iterative statistical based (DOE) development projects for our lead candidates and perform all of the analytical testing for these studies. Additionally, I am the lead mass spec scientist, running analysis and developing
                        assays and also developing methods for machine learning with regards to mass spec. 
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    </br>
                        Perviously, I worked at KBI Biopharma in Louisville, Colorado as a lead formulation scientist. At KBI, I started on the biophysical sciences team where I learned and became fluent in all biophysical methods including AUC,
                        CD, DSC, FTIR, fluorescence, DLS, and DSF. After being on the biophysical team, I tranisitioned to the biochemical team where I learned and became fluent using HPLC, UPLCs, their associated methods, and was KBI's subject matter expert in light scattering (MALS and DLS).
                        Additionally, I became fluent in mass spectrometry having used Q-TOFs, TOFs, Orbitraps, and LTQs and was the mass spec lead on multiple projects. Through this work, I was leading formulation development projects, where
                        I would design and execute iterative statistical based (DOE) development projects for many pharmaceutical modalities. 
                    </br></br>
                        In addition to my wet-lab scientist role, I also lead data science efforts at at KBI. Using my fluency in Python and Dash, I developed multiple python applications
                        which could reduce analysis time for scientists or fix problems. Notably I designed a tool which could correct absorbance measurements for light scattering which was published in the Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences in 2023.

                        My programming language of choice is Python and overall I am very fluent in it. I started coding all the way back in my undergraduate coursework and started using Python during my time at KBI and in my
                        Masters thesis work. During this work, I quickly learned the basics of using Jupyter notebooks, importing data, using pandas for dataframe management, and plotly for data
                        visualization. From working with First Principles Biopharma, one of the companies hosting my thesis work, I learned Git and Github for version control,
                        collaborations, and working on a programming team. During that experience, I also learned how to use Plotly's Dash and Docker for generating and deploying web based applications
                        using Python and I implemented my thesis work on their website. 
                    </br></br>
                        At my current job, I frequently use python for data analysis/visualization, however I also use it for machine learning in mass spectrometry and formulation development purposes. In this work, I take data that 
                        I have collected to generate a dataset and train the machine learning model. For example, we collect melting temperature data (Tm) and relate it to the amino acid sequence to see if we could predict
                        what motifs in the amino acid sequence are critical for protein stability.
                    </br></br>
                        At KBI, I used my Python skills to develop multiple applications which could remove critical bottle necks in analytical workflows. One application I made would decipher and deconvolute large proteomic mass spectrometry datasets
                        to remove the time that scientists would spend exporting data by hand. 
                    </br></br>
                        Past that, I have experience using other programming languages including, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS (which this website is made from), R, SQL, VBA, and matlab. I also have experience using bash scripting and Linux operating systems.

                        I earned my Master of Science degree in Pharmaceutical Science from the University of Colorado Anschutz School of Pharmacy. While I was there I did a research thesis titled "A Novel Approach for the Correction of Absorbance Measurements for Light Scattering"
                        and the recording of my thesis defense can be found on YouTube. I partnered with KBI Biopharma and First Principles Biopharma for this project where I also published this work in the Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences
                        where that publication is open source and can be read here. Through the coursework, I took classes relating to mass spectrometry, machine learning, drug delivery, and protein formulation, just to name a few. 
                    </br></br>
                        Before this, I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical and Biological Engineering with a minor in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Colorado Boulder School of Engineering. While I was there I worked in a reasearch lab under Dr. Gin and Dr. Noble where I worked to create new lyotropic 
                        liquid crystalline membranes for desalnation of water and iron flow battery purposes. A couple of those projects that I worked on were also published, see my publications section below. Through this coursework, I took 
                        courses related to biomaterials, drug kinetics, drug discovery, and computational engineering.
